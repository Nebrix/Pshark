# windows installation
Run powershell as administrator and then cd into the build directory.

After, run the the following command into the powershell:
```
./build.ps1
```
# linux installation
Run the terminal in your linux environment and [install powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-debian?view=powershell-7.3) manually. 

Next, do the same thing that we did in the windows installation and run the powershell script:
```
./build.ps1
